Version 2.2 (May 2004)
- Fixed missing/extra border cells in tileable square grids with low
  randomness.
- Due to typo in formula correlation was reducing randomness a way too much,
  this was fixed and larger ranges of randomnes and correlation were allowed.
- Reset properly resets `Invert' state.
- Dialog buttons were reordered to follow HIG and stock Reset is used instead
  Defaults.


Version 2.1 (May 2004)
- Unpredictable randomness effect depending on cell size for small
  correlations was fixed.
- Different quantitiative effect of Interstitials/Vacancies on different
  grid types was fixed.
- It is possible to map the gradient inverted [PDB change].


Version 2.0 (May 2004)
A substantial rewrite, not even nearly PDB level compatible.
- Full support for horizontal/vertical tileability.
- Visualization types can be mixed with arbitrary weights.
- Preview shows real cell size when feasible and displays zoom value when it
  is not.
- Grid dislocations: interstitials and vacancies.
- New visualization type: scalar product.
- New grid types: rhomb, vertical triangle and hexagon.
- Random solid colors are kept consistent when randomization changes.
- `Coupling' parameter replaced with well defined autocorrelation length.
- Various small improvements and bugfixes.
- NEWS split to separate file, README updated, `About' dialog.
Known issues:
- It's slow and bloated.
- Large cells are deformed even when tileability is not required.


Version 1.5 (Apr 2004)
- Fixed random seed initialization to match the new API.
- Added random_seed to PlasmaVals to remember `Randomize' gui state.
- Using GRand to get random numbers.
- Some clean-up.


Version 1.4 (Jan 2004)
- Changed dialog construction and main event loop to work with gimp-1.3.23.
- Some code cleanup.


Version 1.3 (Oct 2003)
- Works with gimp-1.3.21 and newer.


Version 1.2 (Jan 2003)
- Ported to use the new Gimp random seed widget (great!).


Version 1.1 (Oct 2002)
Ported to Gimp-1.3/Gtk-2.0:
- Renamed and retyped stuff as necessary
- Created a brand new preview widget using GtkImage & GdkPixbuf
- Stockized stock items and reordered buttons to Gtk-2.0 order.
  Can't use GIMP_STOCK_RESET, becuase its label associates `Defaults' while
  its image `Revert'
- Added accels to labels.  FIXME: Ugly Gimp random seed doesn't work
- Removed Esc-exits accel, since Gtk-2.0 does it itself


Version 1.0 (Sep 2001)
- This is the first version.  No news, no changes, no known bugs.
